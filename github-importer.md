## Idea

When importing projects from BitBucket, GitLab etc, the GitHub tool only imports the git repository and not the issues and pull/merge requests which can be annoying
if you want all your data in GitHub

Build a command line tool (in Python,C# or JavaScript/TypeScript) that takes the BitBucket/GitLab repository and imports all relevant data to GitHub(atleast all
data that is compatible)
